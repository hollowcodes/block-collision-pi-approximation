Concept:
counting the collsions bewtween two blocks (rect1, rect2); counter shows the x first digits of pi

mass(rect2) = 1, mass(rect1) = 1  => 3                                                                                                   
mass(rect2) = 100, mass(rect1) = 1  => 31                                                                                               
mass(rect2) = 10000, mass(rect1) = 1  => 314                                                                                             
mass(rect2) = 1000000, mass(rect1) = 1  => 3141
